        <h2 id="About-Us">Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Life doesn't always turn out the way we have planned or hoped, and for some of us,
            providing even the basic needs for ourselves and our families falls out of reach.
            Many of us are single mothers and struggling families in need of desperate help.

        </p>
        <p>
            Without transportation, finding work and caring for the many needs and challenges
            of raising children becomes a burden too heavy for many to handle. Unfortunately,
            finding proper transportation can be one of the toughest things for single mothers
            and impoverished families to find.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the Cars That Care Foundation, we coordinate donations of un-needed vehicles
            and other recources to provide transportation for needy families. Everyone deserves
            the chance to achieve independnce and the ability to provide for their families.
            We are grateful for any and all help that aids us in assisting those we can.
        </p>
